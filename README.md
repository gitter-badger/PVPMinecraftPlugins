# PVPMinecraftPlugins
A group of simple Minecraft plugins that work with ScriptCraft to add a few epic features to your PVP server!
## An up-to-date list of plugins included:
PlayerJoinMessage<br>
PlayerRespawned
## Dependencies
<a href="http://scriptcraftjs.org">ScriptCraft</a><br>
These plugins (like ScriptCraft) work with any Bukkit/Spigot server.
## Installation
Install <a href="http://scriptcraftjs.org">ScriptCraft</a>, download the zip file above, and extract the .js files to your server's ScriptCraft plugin directory:<br>
To find your server's ScriptCraft plugin directory, visit your server's root folder, then go to /plugins/ScriptCraft/plugins.<br>
Each plugin may require you to look at the code, and change it as necessary (just use common sense) e.g. if there is a line of code that says [Your Message Here], then replace it with a message of your choice.
